# 🚀 CampusDash  

CampusDash is our **MVP** submission for **Hack Knight Spring 2025**, designed to make food delivery on **Queens College campus** more convenient and affordable. This platform empowers students and faculty to order food from on-campus spots and have it delivered by fellow students looking to earn extra cash.

## 📌 How It Works  

### 🛒 **For Customers (Ordering Food)**  
1. **Sign in** with Google authentication.  
2. Choose a food spot from a **campus map (powered by Openstreetmap and Leaflet.js)** or a list of available vendors.  
3. Enter your **order details**, **delivery location (building & room)**, and set a **minimum tip** for the delivery.  
4. A **ticket** is created, which expires if not claimed within a set time.  
5. Track your order and receive **real-time status updates** when a delivery is accepted.  

### 🚴 **For Dashers (Making Deliveries)**  
1. Sign in and choose the **"Make a Delivery"** option.  
2. Receive **new ticket notifications** and claim an order on a **first-come, first-served** basis.  
3. Get **customer details** (name, contact, location) and **order information**.  
4. Complete the delivery and receive a **direct tip** from the customer.  
5. Only one active delivery is allowed per dasher at a time.
